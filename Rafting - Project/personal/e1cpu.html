          We begin our journey with exploring the
          <b>Central Processing Unit</b> within a computer! This is the brain of
          the computer. This is what we will learn to control. If we can learn
          to interact with it using very simple instructions, we will be able to
          control about anything the computer does!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The CPU knows what to do because it receives instructions to do
          certain things. Computers have been around for a minute now and as
          such there are a few standards created that we follow and should be
          aware of as we learn about what these instructions are, and how we can
          give them to the CPU. The are 2 main x86 instruction layouts: AT&T and
          Intel. Inside of Intel's instruction set, all destinations
          (destination for a value or similar) goes first and the source last,
          while AT&T does reverse order. Once we look at the instructions, this
          will become more clear.
        </p>

        <p>
          The X86 architecture makes use of CPU Registers. These are small, very
          fast memory chips with the CPU. We use registers when working with
          memory in assembly. We can also access CPU flags or comparison flags
          if we perform a comparison between 2 registers. These registers have
          different sizes depending on your architecture, 16, 32, or 64 bit.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          X86 is forward compatible, but <b>not</b> backward compatible. This
          means that old programs like 16 bit versions can run just fine on 64
          bit machines, but 64 bit versions cannot run on 16 bit machines. This
          is in part because the CPU registers we use can be shrunk or expanded
          in a figure of speech. Think about it, if you have a 64bit wide
          register but a 16 bit program, it will only need to use the first 16
          bits of that register, this won't cause any issues.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The main difference between the architectures is that 64 bit
          architectures have 8 extra memory registers We cannot access these in
          earlier architectures.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          X86 follows a segmented memory model. This means the code, data, and
          stack are all in different locations in memory. ARM does not follow
          this method and will place addresses wherever.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          X86 also allows us to work with floating point data. To do this we
          have a floating point stack which holds 8 10-byte (80 bit) values.
          These are not CPU registers, but can access them and work with them
          similarly to CPU registers. When we cover them you will learn to work
          with them using PUSH and POP Stack functions.

        <h4>Basic CPU Instructions</h4>
        <p class="leading-text">
          Lets clarify what we mean when we talk about 'instructions' when
          talking about a CPU or Central Processing Unit. For this to happen,
          lets explore what the syntax for an instruction is.

        <p class="list-header">Rules:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An instruction is a command that the CPU will execute. Labels are
            used when using things like branch instructions.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we have 1 operand that normally means it is the source and
            destination. If we have 2 operands then the first is the
            destination, the second is the source
          </li>

          <li>
            A constant / immediate number can only be as big as the bit size in
            use. For example if we are using 32 bits, the maximum number would
            have to be represented in 32 bits.
          </li>

          Rules for operands:
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Both operands can be a register</li>
          <li>One of the operands can be a constant / immediate</li>
          <li>
            One of the operands can be a memory location (a direct address) this
            is done by using brackets []. We'll see this later on
