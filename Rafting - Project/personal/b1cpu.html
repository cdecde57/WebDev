          Where do you begin when learning about computers? Well, it all starts
          with what you have in front of you! You have a keyboard, a mouse, a
          screen, and then a computer. All of these items work together to help
          you perform daily tasks with your computer. Although I would love to
          walk through and explain everything from the top to the bottom, I
          cannot do that here since for my school assignment I don't have the
          time. Let us begin our journey with understanding your computer
          itself, and the foundations behind how it works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your computer has a bunch of pieces within it! These things help
          control your computer. Some of these components include the 'RAM'
          chips, your 'Mother Board', your 'Hard Drive', the 'Power Supply Unit'
          and the 'CPU'. We will focus our time here on the 'CPU', The Central
          Processing Unit. this is the brain of your computer. Everytime you
          drag your mouse or click a key on your keyboard, an electric signal
          goes to your computer's CPU to instruct it to do something such as
          'type the letter A' or 'move my mouse to the top of the screen'.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The other parts of your computer help the CPU. For instance the 'Power
          Supply Unit' or 'PSU' gives power to the machine which is critical to
          turning on and using the computer. The 'Hard Drive' you have in your
          machine holds all of your files. The CPU will draw upon the data here
          to write or save different files. The RAM chips within your computer
          are known as 'Random Access Memory' they hold memory or data that is
          used by the CPU. Your CPU will work with these chips a lot when
          computing and performing tasks. Anytime you open a program on your
          computer, information about it is stored in the RAM so the CPU can
          compute and display the application (with the help of your computer
          screen and a graphics processing unit - essentially a 'cpu' for your
          monitor) and let you use its' functionalities. The 'Mother Board' is a
          big 'ol chip in your computer that everything connects to. The
          motherboard is the glue that connects everyone to each other.

          Are you ready to explore how the CPU controls everything on your
          computer? Well thankfully the idea is very simple. You know how I
          mentioned that one thing, the 'Power Supply Unit' and how it powers
          your computer? Well, it allows your computer to turn on, yes, but
          electricity is also how all the other chips and pieces will
          communicate with each other! It is how the CPU will compute data and
          communicate with your monitor to show applications on your screen! So
          how does this happen? How does electricity have this 'power' in
          communication? Well, just like we humans talk, computers talk too...
          Not English or Spanish, but something called <b>binary</b>! I will
          teach you this language in 4 words - ready? - "Power On Power Off".
          You can now speak fluent binary! Congratulations! Well, I guess more
          accurately you know the alphabet so-to-speak for binary. Lets try to
          better understand what Binary really is!
