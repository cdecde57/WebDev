          If you're seeking a place to learn more about your computer and
          ultimately to control it from a basic to a deep level, then this is
          the place for you. Don't worry if you're a newbie when it comes to
          computers or if you're very seasoned, this webpage can help you grow
          your understanding!

          This website will organize information about computer concepts into
          two separate paths. The first starts at a basic level and has lots of
          detail. The second starts at an advanced level and is more
          to-the-point. In the title you will see modules organzed starting with
          a letter such as "<b>B</b>". This tells you that this is a module
          constructed at a
          <b>b</b>asic level. If you're a newbie, these are great. If you see
          the label similar to "<b>E</b>" it means that this is a module
          constructed at a more <b>e</b>xperienced level.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the current time, the website has content that covers basics to the
          X86 Assembly Language and will start you off with learning about the
          CPU, AKA the brain of your computer. Feel assured however that more
          content will be coming in as time goes by!

          Back in 2020, I started getting into computer architecture after
          finding that your computer monitor is <b>not</b> the same thing as
          your computer itself - I was clueless when it came to computers - My
          journey with learning was all self-taught which meant visiting
          websites like, well, this one you are at right now! The main struggle
          however is I found it very hard to grasp since most often the
          resources I found were not well organized, started you off at an
          'intermediate' or 'advanced' level without explaining the
          fundamentals. With this said, this website focuses on giving any
          individual the ability to start learning at a very basic to an
          advanced level so that you can grow in understanding no matter where
          you are at!

      <div class="reading-text">
        <p>
          Thank you for visiting our website! There's a few resources /
          institutions we want to recognize that assisted in the creation of
          this website along with some details behind why / how this page was
          made.
          <br />
          <br />
          Much of my understanding of x86 Assembly came from the resources by
          the
          <b>Indian Institute of Technology Delhi</b>
          <a href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/">IITD</a> and specifically the
          following book
          <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~srsarangi/archbooksoft.html"
            >Computer Organisation and Architecture</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly I would like to thank ChatGPT for generating some of the images
          that populate this website - don't worry, that was it. Everything else
          here is hand typed by a human - me :)
