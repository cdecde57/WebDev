        If you're seeking a place to learn more about your computer and
        ultimately to control it from a basic to a deep level, then this is the
        place for you. Don't worry if you're a newbie when it comes to computers
        or if you're very seasoned, this webpage can help you grow your
        understanding!

      <br />
      <p>
        This website will organize information about computer concepts into two
        separate paths. The first starts at a basic level and has lots of
        detail. The second starts at an advanced level and is more to-the-point.
        In the title you will see modules organzed starting with a letter such
        as "<b>B</b>". This tells you that this is a module constructed at a
        <b>b</b>asic level. If you're a newbie, these are great. If you see the
        label similar to "<b>E</b>" it means that this is a module constructed
        at a more <b>e</b>xperienced level.

        At the current time, the website has content that covers basics to the
        X86 Assembly Language and will start you off with learning about the
        CPU, AKA the brain of your computer. Feel assured however that more
        content will be coming in as time goes by!

        Back in 2020, I started getting into computer architecture after finding
        that your computer monitor is <b>not</b> the same thing as your computer
        itself - I was clueless when it came to computers - My journey with
        learning was all self-taught which meant visiting websites like, well,
        this one you are at right now! The main struggle however is I found it
        very hard to grasp since most often the resources I found were not well
        organized, started you off at an 'intermediate' or 'advanced' level
        without explaining the fundamentals. With this said, this website
        focuses on giving any individual the ability to start learning at a very
        basic to an advanced level so that you can grow in understanding no
        matter where you are at!

      <h3>B1.0 : The CPU</h3>
      <p class="leading-text">
        Where do you begin when learning about computers? Well, it all starts
        with what you have in front of you! You have a keyboard, a mouse, a
        screen, and then a computer. All of these items work together to help
        you perform daily tasks with your computer. Although I would love to
        walk through and explain everything from the top to the bottom, I cannot
        do that here since for my school assignment I don't have the time. Let
        us begin our journey with understanding your computer itself, and the
        foundations behind how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your computer has a bunch of pieces within it! These things help control
        your computer. Some of these components include the 'RAM' chips, your
        'Mother Board', your 'Hard Drive', the 'Power Supply Unit' and the
        'CPU'. We will focus our time here on the 'CPU', The Central Processing
        Unit. this is the brain of your computer. Everytime you drag your mouse
        or click a key on your keyboard, an electric signal goes to your
        computer's CPU to instruct it to do something such as 'type the letter
        A' or 'move my mouse to the top of the screen'.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The other parts of your computer help the CPU. For instance the 'Power
        Supply Unit' or 'PSU' gives power to the machine which is critical to
        turning on and using the computer. The 'Hard Drive' you have in your
        machine holds all of your files. The CPU will draw upon the data here to
        write or save different files. The RAM chips within your computer are
        known as 'Random Access Memory' they hold memory or data that is used by
        the CPU. Your CPU will work with these chips a lot when computing and
        performing tasks. Anytime you open a program on your computer,
        information about it is stored in the RAM so the CPU can compute and
        display the application (with the help of your computer screen and a
        graphics processing unit - essentially a 'cpu' for your monitor) and let
        you use its' functionalities. The 'Mother Board' is a big 'ol chip in
        your computer that everything connects to. The motherboard is the glue
        that connects everyone to each other.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Are you ready to explore how the CPU controls everything on your
        computer? Well thankfully the idea is very simple. You know how I
        mentioned that one thing, the 'Power Supply Unit' and how it powers your
        computer? Well, it allows your computer to turn on, yes, but electricity
        is also how all the other chips and pieces will communicate with each
        other! It is how the CPU will compute data and communicate with your
        monitor to show applications on your screen! So how does this happen?
        How does electricity have this 'power' in communication? Well, just like
        we humans talk, computers talk too... Not English or Spanish, but
        something called <b>binary</b>! I will teach you this language in 4
        words - ready? - "Power On Power Off". You can now speak fluent binary!
        Congratulations! Well, I guess more accurately you know the alphabet
        so-to-speak for binary. Lets try to better understand what Binary really is!

      <h3>E1.0 : The CPU</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->

      <h4>The X86 Machine Model</h4>
      <p class="leading-text">
        We begin our journey with exploring the
        <b>Central Processing Unit</b> within a computer! This is the brain of
        the computer. This is what we will learn to control. If we can learn to
        interact with it using very simple instructions, we will be able to
        control about anything the computer does!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The CPU knows what to do because it receives instructions to do certain
        things. Computers have been around for a minute now and as such there
        are a few standards created that we follow and should be aware of as we
        learn about what these instructions are, and how we can give them to the
        CPU. The are 2 main x86 instruction layouts: AT&T and Intel. Inside of
        Intel's instruction set, all destinations (destination for a value or
        similar) goes first and the source last, while AT&T does reverse order.
        Once we look at the instructions, this will become more clear.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The X86 architecture makes use of CPU Registers. These are small, very
        fast memory chips with the CPU. We use registers when working with
        memory in assembly. We can also access CPU flags or comparison flags if
        we perform a comparison between 2 registers. These registers have
        different sizes depending on your architecture, 16, 32, or 64 bit.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        X86 is forward compatible, but <b>not</b> backward compatible. This
        means that old programs like 16 bit versions can run just fine on 64 bit
        machines, but 64 bit versions cannot run on 16 bit machines. This is in
        part because the CPU registers we use can be shrunk or expanded in a
        figure of speech. Think about it, if you have a 64bit wide register but
        a 16 bit program, it will only need to use the first 16 bits of that
        register, this won't cause any issues.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The main difference between the architectures is that 64 bit
        architectures have 8 extra memory registers We cannot access these in
        earlier architectures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        X86 follows a segmented memory model. This means the code, data, and
        stack are all in different locations in memory. ARM does not follow this
        method and will place addresses wherever.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        X86 also allows us to work with floating point data. To do this we have
        a floating point stack which holds 8 10-byte (80 bit) values. These are
        not CPU registers, but can access them and work with them similarly to
        CPU registers. When we cover them you will learn to work with them using
        PUSH and POP Stack functions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Basic CPU Instructions</h4>
      <p class="leading-text">
        Lets clarify what we mean when we talk about 'instructions' when talking
        about a CPU or Central Processing Unit. For this to happen, lets explore
        what the syntax for an instruction is.
      </p>
      <br />

      <pre class="code">
  
        &lt;label&gt; &lt;assembly instruction&gt; ; comment
        &lt;assembly instruction&gt; ; comment
        &lt;assembly instruction&gt; &lt;operand 1&gt; ; comment
        &lt;assembly instruction&gt; &lt;operand 1&gt; &lt;operand 2&gt; ; comment
      </pre>
      <br />
      <p class="list-header">Rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An instruction is a command that the CPU will execute. Labels are used
          when using things like branch instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we have 1 operand that normally means it is the source and
          destination. If we have 2 operands then the first is the destination,
          the second is the source
        </li>

        <li>
          A constant / immediate number can only be as big as the bit size in
          use. For example if we are using 32 bits, the maximum number would
          have to be represented in 32 bits.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <ul class="list-header">
        Rules for operands:
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Both operands can be a register</li>
        <li>One of the operands can be a constant / immediate</li>
        <li>
          One of the operands can be a memory location (a direct address) this
          is done by using brackets []. We'll see this later on
        </li>
      </ul>
